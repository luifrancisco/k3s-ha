# k3s-ha

Welcome to my first major homelab project. This repository contains all terraform and ansible scripts that will help you spin up your own kubernetes cluster with HA in place.

Terraform will be used to instantiate the VMs on Proxmox and Ansible to configure the cluster from scratch.

The terraform script by default will 3 VMs with two disks attached.

How to use:
1. Download the repository
git clone
